# Escape-From-Mars
A 2.5D scrolling, physics-puzzle game where you need to lead a flying rocket to the end of the level by navigating through the level and overcoming the different challenges.

This game is based on the Project Boost section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.

My original implementations are:
- Levels built with SabreCSG
- Death animation by dismembering the rocket and using a different particle effect.
- Design of original challenges, like dodging ventilators, air currents, homing missiles and other space rockets.
- Windtrails in the 3rd level as affordance (together with the ambience music) to signal the existence of wind that pushes the player to the right.
- A checkpoint system that divides the 2nd and 3rd level into 2 parts.
- A switch system in the 2nd level to activate interactive devices.
